This plugin provides a widget for your siteâ€™s most recent posts with ajax.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a widget which is like the built-in 'Recent Posts'. The main
and only difference is that the built-in one doesn't update posts dynamicly.
The widget this plugin provides, works as simple as to check if there are newly
published posts in certain interval of time, and add them dynamicly.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `gsy-ajax-recent-posts` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the newly created widget 'Ajax Recent Posts' in the Widgets area
4. Click on the added widget and customize it as you wish:
  4.1. Title
  4.2. Number of posts to show
  4.3. Set interval time - after how many seconds to check for new published posts
  4.4. Display post date?
